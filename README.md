# AR_filters

## Inspiration
For now, augmented reality (AR) is still largely a novelty -- AR's newness alone contributes to its ability to surpass print, online, and television advertisements in terms of shock-factor. As The Drum reports, AR can capture people’s attention for over 85 seconds, increase interaction rates by 20 percent, and improve click-through rates to purchase by 33 percent.

**Tim Cook**, Apple’s CEO, has said that ```AR will one day be as important in our everyday lives as “eating three meals a day.”``` 

## What it does
It is AR filters for Instagram and Facebook. Basically, I made two of them. It's also uploaded on Instagram and Facebook and it's approved.

## Why am I doing this??
Augmented Reality is on-trend. It is something that sounds quite excited and has a lot of future scopes. 

## Tools Used
I'm using a very effective tool i.e., ```Spark AR Studio```. Spark AR Studio is an augmented reality platform for Mac & Windows that allows you to create AR effects somewhat easily for mobile cameras. Think of it like Photoshop or Sketch, but for AR.
